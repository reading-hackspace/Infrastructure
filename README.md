This repository tracks the work of the rLab Infrastructure Working Group. As such, more interesting things are happening in the issues than the repo itself!

Oh cool, a meeting?
-------------------

Yup. Thursdays, 8PM. The meeting is always initiated from the Slack and uses a Google Hangout, so anyone should be able to make it.

Is there an Agenda?
-------------------

Yup:
- Stories completed
  - Are they ready to be accepted?
- Stories in progress
  - How can we progress them?
- Work in the backlog
  - Are they ready to do?
  - Who will do them?
  - (But only when someone is interested in bringing it up)

What is the IWG?
----------------

An elastic team of people that will collectively start to take ownership of the rLab infrastructure. We co-ordinate via this repository, the [waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/reading-hackspace/Infrastructure) and Slack. The group consists of whoever turns up to the meetings.

What is the rLab Infrastructure?
--------------------------------

It includes, but is not limited to:
- rLab Website
- rLab Wiki
- Signup Form
- DNS Server
- Internet connectivity
- Modem/Router
- Internal Virtual Host and VMs
- Pi Cameras
- Door Entry System
- Energy Monitor
- Comms (Google Group/Slack/Google Calendar)

So you guys run all this stuff?
-------------------------------

No! Traditionally, infrastructure has been run by the person who implemented it, and if they're still actively managing it then they still do. Items of infrastructure need to be added to the backlog and worked to the point that the group are prepared to take joint responsibility. There's a list of non-functional requirements in this repository that all items of infrastructure are tested against before they're accepted.

I don't want my stuff to be involved in this
--------------------------------------------

There's no requirement to do so. None of us are even required to be here. We're just passing the time until the coming armageddon - should be any day now.
