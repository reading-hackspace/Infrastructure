Non-Functional Requirements
===========================

FAQ
---
### What are non-functional requirements?
Constraints on the work we do that aren't actual functions of the software. "This button must beep when pressed" is a functional requirement - "No-one should have to maintain this button" is non-functional.

### Why are they here?
For the Infrastructure Working Group at rLab, these act as acceptance criteria for items of infrastructure. The hackspace is a completely voluntary do-ocracy, with specific requirements that wouldn't exist in a traditional business.

### You're doing NFRs all wrong!
Possibly - this is simplified to make it usable and accessible for a diverse team in a diverse organisation. We're always looking for ways to improve - join us!

### Can I add some? Delete some? Change some?
Sure! Make a pull request, which can be debated by the group before being accepted as a change.

The Requirements
----------------
0. **Zero-maintenance**. No infrastructure should require a rLab member to do regular maintenance to keep the item up, working properly, or kept secure.
1. **Users must be defined, and happy**. Building a technically perfect system that users don't want to use is not alright.
2. **Documentation**. Enough documentation should be provided with the item to ensure there is not a requirement for the original creator to be present for modifications and updates to be made.
